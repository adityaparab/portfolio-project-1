# InvoiceOps Agent

**An agentic, human-in-the-loop invoice processing system for Source-to-Pay — built as a production-honest, scaled-down version of what an enterprise GenAI platform team ships at a bank.**

> Portfolio Project 1 of 3 · Target roles: Citi Lead Python AI Principal Engineer / Gen AI Transformation Lead (Source-to-Pay) · Status: **Building** — platform skeleton + ingestion/extraction/eval baseline shipped (Phases 0–1 of [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), 27/57 tracker issues closed)

---

## 1. What This Project Is

InvoiceOps Agent is an end-to-end **agentic invoice processing platform** that automates the accounts-payable intake-to-approval workflow:

1. **Ingest** invoices (email attachment, upload, or API push)
2. **Extract** structured data from unstructured documents (PDFs, scans, photos)
3. **Validate** fields (schema, math, tax, vendor master data)
4. **3-way match** invoice ↔ purchase order ↔ goods receipt against an ERP database
5. **Run policy & compliance checks** (spend limits, approval matrices, duplicate/fraud detection)
6. **Decide**: auto-approve (straight-through processing) or triage to a human with a full evidence package
7. **Record everything**: every decision, model call, tool call, and human action lands in an append-only audit ledger

It is deliberately built the way a bank would require it: **deterministic controls run before and after every LLM call**, humans stay in the loop for consequential decisions, and every output is traceable to its evidence.

### Why this project (for the target roles)

| JD requirement (from the 4 Citi postings) | How this project demonstrates it |
|---|---|
| Agentic & multi-step workflows, tool use, state management, orchestration (JD2 §2) | LangGraph state machine with durable execution, checkpointing, tool-calling agents |
| `FastAPI, ADK, and internal libraries` (JD1) | FastAPI async service; ADK variant of the same agent + comparison ADR |
| Human-in-the-loop validation, guardrails (JD2 §8) | Confidence gate with abstention → HITL exception queue; deterministic policy engine |
| Evaluation frameworks, regression validation (JD1, JD2 §1/§4/§8) | Golden dataset with injected anomalies; eval suite runs in CI on every PR |
| Auditability, data lineage, Risk & Control partnership (JD2 §3/§8, JD3/JD4) | Append-only audit ledger; decision provenance (model + prompt + policy versions) |
| Robust error handling, observability, test coverage (JD1) | Retries, idempotency, DLQ; OpenTelemetry traces per graph node; unit + integration + eval tests |
| Financial industry / Source-to-Pay domain (JD2 role title; "financial industry is a major advantage") | The core AP workflow: 3-way match, exception handling, approval routing |

## 2. Problem Statement

In a large bank's Source-to-Pay organization, accounts payable teams process tens of thousands of vendor invoices per month. The dominant cost is **exception handling**: invoices that fail a match, miss a PO, exceed a limit, or look fraudulent require a human to pull documents, compare line items, chase vendors, and document the decision for auditors.

Classic OCR + RPA automated the happy path but breaks on layout variety and can't reason about *why* an invoice fails or *what to do next*. Pure LLM chatbots are unusable here: no audit trail, no determinism, no controls.

**The gap this project fills:** an agent system that combines LLM extraction and reasoning with deterministic matching/policy controls and structured human-in-the-loop escalation — measured with a real evaluation harness, not vibes.

### Goals

- **G1** — Automate intake → decision for ≥ 70% of invoices with zero policy violations (straight-through processing rate)
- **G2** — Detect ≥ 98% of injected anomalies (duplicates, mismatches, fraud patterns) at ≤ 5% false-escalation rate
- **G3** — Every automated decision reconstructible from the audit ledger in under 1 minute
- **G4** — Field-level extraction F1 ≥ 0.95 on the golden dataset
- **G5** — Cost per invoice ≤ $0.04 and p95 end-to-end latency ≤ 45s for the auto-approve path

### Non-goals (explicitly out of scope)

- Payment execution / ERP writeback (simulated with a stub)
- Vendor onboarding or sourcing (upstream S2P stages)
- Training custom OCR models (we use open OCR/VLM tools; fine-tuning is Project 4)
- Multi-tenant, SSO, real bank data — **synthetic data only**

## 3. Personas

| Persona | Role | What they need from the system |
|---|---|---|
| **Maria Chen** | AP Analyst (primary user) | A prioritized exception queue with evidence packages — comparisons, agent findings, suggested actions — so she can clear exceptions in minutes, not hours |
| **Dan Okafor** | Procurement Ops Manager | Dashboard: volumes, STP rate, aging exceptions, cost per invoice; confidence that nothing policy-violating auto-approves |
| **Priya Sharma** | Internal Audit / Risk | Full decision provenance: who/what decided, based on which evidence, using which model & policy versions; exportable trails |
| **Platform Engineer** (you, in the demo narrative) | Runs the platform | Traces, evals in CI, model-routing policy, cost telemetry |

---

## 4. User Journey (summary — full detail in [docs/USER_JOURNEY.md](docs/USER_JOURNEY.md))

**Happy path (straight-through):** Invoice arrives by email → agent extracts fields (VLM/OCR tool) → schema + math validation passes → 3-way match succeeds → policy checks pass → confidence ≥ threshold → auto-approve → archived with full trace → queued for payment. No human touched it; a human can reconstruct why.

**Exception path (the interesting one):** Price mismatch found in 3-way match → agent gathers evidence, computes deltas, classifies exception type, drafts a recommendation → lands in Maria's queue → Maria reviews the side-by-side comparison and agent analysis → approves / returns to vendor / escalates → decision written to audit ledger with her identity → metrics update.

**Working mock:** open **[`mocks/index.html`](mocks/index.html)** in any browser (self-contained, no server or internet needed). It walks through all screens — Dashboard → Intake → animated Agent Run → Exception Review with 3-way match → Audit/Trace → Evals — and both paths (auto-approve and exception) are clickable.

**Video:** a 3–4 minute recorded demo following [docs/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md](docs/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md) (script written; recording happens when the real system is live).

**Stack:** Python 3.12 · LangGraph (+ Google ADK variant) · FastAPI (async) · PostgreSQL + pgvector (ERP-sim + ledger) · Surya/Marker or Qwen-VL for document extraction · Pydantic v2 for schema contracts · Docker Compose · GitHub Actions (unit → integration → **eval gate**) · OpenTelemetry + Langfuse + Grafana.

**Key design decisions (ADRs live in [`adr/`](adr/)):**

1. **Determinism at the edges, intelligence in the middle.** Matching and policy are deterministic code; the LLM handles extraction, classification, and evidence summarization. This is what makes the system auditable. — [ADR 0001](adr/0001-deterministic-matcher-policy.md)
2. **Confidence gate with abstention.** Below threshold τ the system *must* escalate rather than guess — tuning τ is an eval-driven decision, documented as an experiment. — [ADR 0003](adr/0003-composite-confidence-gate.md)
3. **ADK and LangGraph variants of the same graph**, with an ADR comparing developer ergonomics, checkpointing, observability, and cloud fit — demonstrating framework judgment, not framework loyalty. — [ADR 0002](adr/0002-langgraph-primary-adk-variant.md)
4. **Every LLM call goes through the LLM Gateway**: model routing by task class and data-sensitivity tier, semantic caching, PII redaction, token budgets, cost telemetry. — [ADR 0005](adr/0005-gateway-only-model-traffic.md) (implemented as a LiteLLM proxy with virtual model aliases)
5. **Synthetic data only**, generated with known ground truth — itself a talking point about data governance in banking. — [ADR 0006](adr/0006-synthetic-data-anomalies.md)
6. **Append-only audit ledger** with point-in-time version pinning — [ADR 0004](adr/0004-append-only-ledger.md) · **deterministic replay in tests** via recorded LLM cassettes — [ADR 0007](adr/0007-vcr-cassettes.md)

## 6. Data Strategy (summary — details in [docs/EVALUATION.md](docs/EVALUATION.md))

- **Base corpus:** [Voxel51 High-Quality Invoice Images for OCR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Voxel51/high-quality-invoice-images-for-ocr) (8,181 images, 1,489 fully annotated)
- **Synthetic ERP:** Faker-generated vendors, purchase orders, and goods receipts in Postgres, so 3-way matches have a ground-truth backend
- **Anomaly injection:** a controlled catalog of 10 anomaly types (duplicate invoice, price mismatch, quantity mismatch, missing PO, vendor-bank-detail change, currency mismatch, tax errors, line-math errors, stale/closed PO, partial-delivery mismatch) with prevalence weights mirroring real AP queues
- **Golden dataset:** 500 labeled invoices (≈350 clean, ≈150 anomalous) held out for eval; test/train discipline enforced in the harness

## 7. Evaluation & Metrics (summary — details in [docs/EVALUATION.md](docs/EVALUATION.md))

| Metric | Target | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Straight-through processing (STP) rate | ≥ 70% | % of invoices auto-approved with zero human touch |
| Exception detection F1 | ≥ 0.98 recall, ≤ 0.05 false-escalation | Against injected anomalies, per type + macro |
| Extraction field F1 | ≥ 0.95 | Per-field exact match over golden labels (vendor, IBAN, amounts, dates, line items) |
| Cost per invoice | ≤ $0.04 | Tokens × unit price, averaged over the golden set |
| p95 latency | ≤ 45s | Auto-approve path, end-to-end |
| Audit reconstruction time | ≤ 1 min | From invoice ID → complete decision provenance |

The eval suite is a **CI gate**: pull requests fail if any metric regresses beyond tolerance. Version-over-version results are published as a report (the "experiment log") — the flagship written artifact of this project.

## 8. Governance & Controls Mapping

| Control (engineering) | Regulatory anchor |
|---|---|
| Append-only audit ledger, decision provenance (model, prompt, policy versions) | OCC Bulletin 2026-13 (successor to SR 11-7) documentation & validation expectations; EU AI Act Art. 12 record-keeping |
| Human-in-the-loop for consequential decisions, confidence abstention | EU AI Act human-oversight requirements for high-risk systems |
| Eval suite + regression gates in CI | Model validation / ongoing monitoring expectations |
| PII redaction + data-sensitivity routing via LLM Gateway | Data-minimization and privacy-by-design principles |
| Deterministic policy checks independent of the LLM | Model-risk principle: controls not solely dependent on the model being validated |

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| VLM extraction accuracy on poor scans | Preprocessing pipeline + confidence gating escalates rather than guessing; report accuracy by document-quality tier |
| Synthetic data → "too clean" results | Inject layout noise, rotations, stamps, handwriting-style artifacts; publish per-tier metrics |
| Agent nondeterminism flaky tests | Deterministic replay in tests via recorded LLM responses (VCR-style); eval suite uses fixed seeds + N-run averaging |
| Scope creep toward full ERP simulation | Non-goals enforced; payment is a stub; PR template includes scope check |
