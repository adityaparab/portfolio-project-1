## Technology Stack (locked)

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | **3.12** | Align `.python-version` + `pyproject.toml` (currently 3.11) |
| Orchestration | **LangGraph** + Postgres checkpointer | Google ADK variant in Phase 6 (ADR 0002) |
| API | **FastAPI** (async, uvicorn), Pydantic v2 | RFC 7807 errors, idempotency-key header |
| DB | **PostgreSQL + pgvector**, raw docs in **MinIO** | ERP sim + ledger + checkpoints |
| LLM access | **LiteLLM proxy** (OpenAI-compliant API) for ALL traffic | App uses only the `openai` SDK + one base URL; virtual model aliases (`extract-vision`, `triage-reasoner`, …) map to backends per environment |
| LLM backends | **Dev:** local models (Ollama) via LiteLLM · **Prod/eval:** OpenAI | Switching = config change in `deploy/litellm/config.yaml`, no code change |
| Extraction | Dev: local vision model (Ollama-backed) · Prod: hosted vision LLM (e.g. GPT-4o class) | Routed via LiteLLM alias `extract-vision` |
| Observability | **OpenTelemetry** (span per graph node), **Langfuse** (LLM traces), **Prometheus + Grafana** | Cost telemetry reads LiteLLM spend logs too |
| Testing | pytest, hypothesis, testcontainers, schemathesis, VCR-style cassettes | ADR 0007 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions: ruff → mypy → unit → integration → **eval gate** → build | Gate: fail PR on >0.5% absolute regression or metric-floor breach |
| Front end | **React + TypeScript (Vite)** · **Mantine** UI library | See "Front-End Stack" below |
| Deployment | Docker Compose (api, worker, postgres, minio, litellm, langfuse, grafana+prometheus, seed) | Cloud variant documented as notes only |

**Open items to decide at Phase 0 start:** concrete model names in the LiteLLM routing table (which Ollama model, which OpenAI model).

### Front-End Stack (locked)

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework / build | React + TypeScript, **Vite** |
| UI components | **Mantine** (v7+) with `@mantine/hooks`, `@mantine/notifications`, `@mantine/dates` |
| Server state | **TanStack Query** |
| Tables | **TanStack Table** (exception queue, invoice list) with Mantine styling |
| Forms & validation | **react-hook-form** + **Zod** (Zod schemas mirror the Pydantic API contracts) |
| Charts | **Recharts** (STP rate, cost per invoice, latency, aging) |
| Routing | **React Router** |
| API client | `fetch`/`openapi-fetch` client generated from FastAPI's OpenAPI schema |
| Auth UX | Persona switcher (Maria / Dan / Priya / Platform Eng) driving RBAC views; service-token auth against the API |

**Screens (from `mocks/index.html` + docs/USER_JOURNEY.md):** Dashboard (Dan), Intake, Agent Run (live graph progress), Exception Review with 3-way match comparison (Maria), Audit/Trace & Provenance (Priya), Evals view (experiment log).

## Phase 0 — Repo & Platform Skeleton (Week 1)

**Exit criteria:** FastAPI + Postgres + LangGraph hello-path in Docker Compose; CI green.

- [x] 0.1 Restructure to `src/` layout per README §9; remove `hello.py`; pin dev tooling (ruff, mypy strict, pytest, pytest-asyncio) as uv dev-dependencies
- [x] 0.2 Bump Python to 3.12 in `.python-version` and `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] 0.3 Docker Compose stack: `api`, `postgres` (pgvector), `minio`, `litellm`; one-shot `seed` service placeholder; `langfuse` + `grafana`/`prometheus` deferred to Phase 4
- [ ] 0.4 `deploy/litellm/config.yaml` with virtual aliases (`extract-vision`, `triage-reasoner`) mapped to dev (Ollama) / prod (OpenAI) models; API key handling via env
- [ ] 0.5 FastAPI app shell: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, RFC 7807 error handler, Pydantic v2 settings, idempotency-key middleware
- [ ] 0.6 Alembic migrations for full schema (ARCHITECTURE §6): `vendors`, `purchase_orders`, `goods_receipts`, `invoices` (unique `content_hash`), `invoice_lines`, `runs`, `checkpoints`, `ledger`, `exceptions`, `decisions`
- [ ] 0.7 Append-only enforcement on `ledger` + `decisions` (grants + triggers)
- [ ] 0.8 LangGraph hello-path graph (stub nodes) with Postgres checkpointer, run end-to-end in Compose
- [x] 0.9 GitHub Actions CI: ruff → mypy → pytest, running against Compose (or testcontainers)

- [ ] 1.5 Gateway client: thin `openai`-SDK wrapper over LiteLLM endpoint — virtual aliases, PII redaction, schema validation, token budgets, retries/backoff
- [ ] 1.6 Extraction agent: doc → typed `InvoiceExtraction` (Pydantic) with per-field confidence, via `extract-vision` alias
- [ ] 1.7 Validate node: schema checks, line-math, tax checks (deterministic)

- [ ] 2.4 Near-duplicate detection via pgvector embeddings
- [ ] 2.5 Policy engine: spend limits, approval matrix, stale/closed-PO checks — deterministic, independent of LLM (ADR 0001)
- [ ] 2.6 Full LangGraph state machine wiring: Ingest → Extract → Validate → Match3Way → Policy → Gate → (AutoApprove | ExceptionTriage) → HumanReview → Archive (+ Reject), checkpoint after every node
- [ ] 2.7 Composite confidence gate: `w1·min(field_conf) + w2·(1−norm_match_delta) + w3·policy_severity_term` (ARCHITECTURE §3.5); τ configurable

- [ ] 3.6 **Screen — Dashboard (Dan):** STP rate, volumes, aging exceptions, cost per invoice, exception-type breakdown (Recharts); drill-through to queue
- [ ] 3.7 **Screen — Intake:** invoice upload with progress, ingestion status, duplicate/reject feedback
- [ ] 3.8 **Screen — Agent Run:** live LangGraph progress per node (polling or SSE), state inspection
- [ ] 3.9 **Screen — Audit/Trace & Provenance (Priya):** run trace (Mantine Timeline), full ledger view with actor/version pins, provenance export
- [ ] 3.10 **Screen — Evals:** experiment-log view — versioned metric tables, per-anomaly confusion, τ sweep chart; reads `eval/reports/`
- [ ] 3.11 Front-end testing: Vitest + React Testing Library on decision form and queue; Playwright smoke of the happy path in CI

## Phase 5 — Eval Harness + CI Gate (Weeks 7–8)

**Exit criteria:** 500-invoice golden set; CI eval gate live; v0.1→v0.3 experiment report published.

- [ ] 5.1 Golden dataset builder: 500 invoices = 350 clean (Voxel51 re-labeled + synthetic; 30 hard negatives with rotation/skew/stamps/faint print) + 150 anomalous (10 seeded codes, weighted prevalences); versioned (`golden/v1.0.0`), seed-pinned, held-out split
- [ ] 5.2 `eval/runners/run_pipeline.py` — drives the real Compose stack through the API (not mocks); `--recorded` cassette mode for smoke
- [ ] 5.3 `metrics.py`: exception recall (≥0.98), false-escalation (≤0.05), field F1 (≥0.95; money fields ≥0.97), routing accuracy (≥0.95), STP (≥0.70), cost (≤$0.04/inv), p95 latency (≤45s, N=3 runs)

## Change Log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-27 | Initial plan. Stack decisions: Python 3.12; all LLM traffic via LiteLLM proxy (OpenAI-compliant API, virtual model aliases); dev = local Ollama-backed models, prod/eval = OpenAI; extraction dev-local / prod-hosted-vision-LLM. |
| 2026-08-27 | Added dedicated front-end scope: React + TypeScript (Vite) with Mantine; TanStack Query/Table, react-hook-form + Zod, Recharts, React Router; API client generated from FastAPI OpenAPI schema. Phase 3 expanded to full UI (six screens, weeks 5–6) with Vitest + Playwright tests. |
| 2026-08-27 | Added `AGENTS.md` (agent coding standards: architecture boundaries, Python/TS conventions, testing rules, audit rules, definition of done) and 8 workspace skills under `.agents/skills/` (fastapi-api, langgraph-orchestration, data-layer, llm-gateway-litellm, frontend-react-mantine, testing, observability, devstack-ops) so agents get stack-specific guidance when touching each layer. |
| 2026-08-27 | GitHub project setup: 8 phase milestones, 10 area labels, and 57 detailed issues (one per step, with summaries, task checklists, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and suggested branch names). Step→issue map recorded above. Renumbered stray duplicate `3.5` → `3.12` (provenance endpoints). |
